## Created by Ricardo Froeliger

1. Create a JavaScript application that calculates the 6 times table
2. Create a JavaScript application that calculates the 3 times table

3. Perform calculations
With text also make sure that you can see the calculation (and not just the result):
* Use the number 12 as the basis for the following calculations:
* Add to the number 6
* Then multiply the result by 10
* Divide the result by 5
* Subtract 12 from the outcome
 
4. Perform calculations with input of a number.
5. Use the same JavaScript code and perform the same calculations as described in step 3, but now you ask the user to enter a number.

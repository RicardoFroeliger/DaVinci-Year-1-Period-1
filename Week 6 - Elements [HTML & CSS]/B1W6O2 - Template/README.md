### Functional Requirements
* For this assignment you only use code that you have written yourself (no copy / paste).
* All fonts used are consistent with the design.
* You create pages for HOME, FEATURES, PAGES, PORTFOLIO, BLOG and CONTACT and you give these pages a matching design (be creative!).

### Code Requirements
* The document is written in HTML5.
* Each of the menu items points to a different html page (which you have to create yourself).
* The font used for the menu items (such as "home", "features") is: `font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;` and the color is `color: rgba (255, 255, 255, 0.8);`.
* The image used for each menu item was created with Font Awesome.
* You have checked the HTML code you wrote with the [html validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
* You have checked the CSS code you wrote with the [css validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).

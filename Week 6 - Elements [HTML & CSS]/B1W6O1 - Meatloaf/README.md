# B1W6O1 - Meatloaf
## Created by Ricardo Froeliger

For this week's assignment, you will try to copy the design (design.png) as close as possible using HTML and CSS. Because you try to copy the design as exactly as possible, there are very concrete technical requirements, read these carefully. The used picture of the meatloaf is also included. You will also make two new pages after working out the design. A recipe of an appetizer and a recipe of a dessert. So eventually we get a website for a three-course menu.

### Functional Requirements
* The customer can visit the webpage via his browser with the meatloaf recipe which exactly matches the design.
* The customer can visit the web page with the recipe for an appetizer via his browser.
* The customer can visit the web page with the recipe for a dessert via his browser.
* The customer can navigate between the different pages via a menu.

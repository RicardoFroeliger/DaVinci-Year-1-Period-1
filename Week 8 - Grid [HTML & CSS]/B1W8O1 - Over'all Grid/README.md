# B1W8L1 - Over'all Grid
## Created by Ricardo Froeliger

For this week's assignment you are going to copy the image (design.png) as close as possible by means of HTML and CSS. Because you try to copy the design as exactly as possible, there are very concrete technical requirements, read these as possible. The pictures used are included.

You will also make two new pages after working out the design.<br>
One page with an explanation of the cars that you can order from this company and one page with the clothes they sell with it.<br>
Of course you place the result of your assignment on GitHub, and submit the link to the GitHub repository.

### Functional Requirements:
* The customer can visit the company's webpage via his browser Over'All which exactly matches the design.
* The customer can visit the webpage with the cars that the company sells via the menu.
* The customer can visit the webpage with the clothing that the company sells via the menu.
* The customer can navigate between the different pages via a menu.
 
### Code Requirements:
* Validate your html and css via https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload.
* Your html and css are neatly aligned, use a grid for this (4 rows and a number of columns per row).
* The font used is Lato. This font is available via google https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato.
* You are using a div to center entire page, this div is 1100px wide.
* The font size of the normal texts is 14px and the line height is 20px.
* The main title has a font size of 26px and a line height of 30px.
* All other titles have a font size of 20px and a line height of 22px.
* There are 3 background images in the supplied file, use them for the correct place (header_bg, banner_bg and footer_bg) and in the css file.
* You make a neat menu (see example) for each page so that you can navigate between the different pages.
* Make sure that all pages have the same look, but you can make something for the background colors (images) yourself.
* Put your own name at the bottom of the footer.
